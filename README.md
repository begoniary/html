# html
This is a html homework. The author is Begoniary, who is a freshman in UCAS. I major in Physics and am not good at html programming.You can type whatever you want, including numbers, English words, Chinese words or maybe Mars Language (if you happen to master that).
As long as you type your text into the text box above, the music box will produce a piece of music, which is based on the text you provide.
I got the inspiration from the Detective Conan ( 名探偵コナン ). In which Sherry uses the sound of the flute to send a message to Conan.
